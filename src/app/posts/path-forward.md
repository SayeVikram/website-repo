title: The path forward

With my first post, I want to reflect on the road ahead: _my future, my career, and my life._

It’s surreal to think that I’m now a graduated senior about to head off to college. The reality of it all is finally sinking in.  
In just two months, I’ll be starting a new chapter, as I make big decisions about:

- who I surround myself with,
- what I choose to study, and
- how I want to shape my career moving forward.

For a while, I was afraid because my path didn’t feel clear.  
To me, it seemed like the possibilities were endless, but so were my interests, and I wasn’t sure if I had the ability to pursue them all.

Recently, I came across a quote that prompted me to write this post:

> **"If the path before you is clear, you’re probably on someone else’s."**  
> — _Unknown_

Growing up, I was taught to believe there was always a right answer:  
a question-answer format to life.

But I’m starting to see how flawed that mindset is.  
My life isn't supposed to have the "right" answer laid out in front of me, simply because it hasn’t been lived yet.

**Life is truly lived at the intersection of uncertainty and curiosity.**  
That’s the mindset I intend to carry with me moving forward.
